# This is my macro for the body formatting
# If you are using Word's Styles functions then you should be able to just run the Header_body fully automatic macro to take care of most of the formatting
# In case that doesn't work, there is Manual Body macro that can be used to format selected text to the IEEE Body formatting.
# The Macros do what their titles say. Comments in the macros themselves describe requirements for making the macro  work as intended.
